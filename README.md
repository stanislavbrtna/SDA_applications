# Applications for the SDA OS
This repo contains applications for the [SDA_OS](https://github.com/stanislavbrtna/SDA_OS/blob/master/README.md). It is part of the larger software suite for the SDA project ([on Hack a Day](https://hackaday.io/project/35165-sda-the-best-new-pda)). You need to get SDL2 base for SDA OS (or compatible HW) to run them.

 Applications are written in [SVS script](https://github.com/stanislavbrtna/svs-script/blob/master/README.md) using SDA OS API.

This repo also contains .mnu files and icons, so you can just clone it to the *APPS* directory of your SDA OS base.

## Work in progress
This is still work in progress, some apps are only in czech language and some of them need specific config files in *DATA* folder. This will be fixed over time.
